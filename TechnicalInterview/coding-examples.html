<h3>Prime Numbers</h3>
<p>
The most basic coding example you might get asked is to write an algorithm to output a series of prime numbers.
Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by one and itself. The algorithm is a 
straight forward iterative algorithm.
</p>
<p>
The number one is obviously a prime number, since it can only be divisible by itself. The
number two is also obviously a prime number, since there are no numbers between one and two
to divide by. Therefore, I generally like to start the iterative process at three, though
you may choose to start it at two.
</p>
<p>
The process is simple. For each number, we attempt to divide it by every number less than it,
except for one. We use the integer modulo operator to test if there is a remainder. If there
is no remainder, it is divisible by the number and therefore not a prime. If all numbers it is
divided by leave a remainder, then it is a prime.
</p>
<h4>Python</h4>
<pre>
print( "Prime Numbers between 1 and 100")

# Prime Numbers are numbers only divisible by 1 and itself.
print( "1" )	
print( "2" )

# Primes for numbers above 2
for number in range( 3, 100 ):
	# Attempt to divide this number by every number between 2 and one less than itself
	for div in range(2,number-1):
		# use the mod function to see if their is a remainder in the division
		if ( number % div ) == 0:
			break
	else:
		print(number)
</pre>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>
public class prime {
	public static void main( String args[] ) {
		System.out.println( "Prime Numbers between 1 and 100");

		// Prime Numbers are numbers only divisible by 1 and itself.
		System.out.println( "1" );
		System.out.println( "2" );

		// Primes for numbers above 2
		for ( int number = 3; number <=100; number++ ) {
			// Attempt to divide this number by every number between 2 and one less than itself
			int div = 2;
			for ( /**/; div < number; div++ ) {
				// use the mod function to see if their is a remainder in the division
				if ( ( number % div ) == 0 )
					break;
			}
			if ( div == number )
				System.out.println(number);
		}
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
Can we make an improvement? Yes. Since we know all even numbers are divisible by two, we
can skip testing even numbers and only test odd numbers.
</p>

<h4>Python</h4>
<pre>
print( "Prime Numbers between 1 and 100")

# Prime Numbers are numbers only divisible by 1 and itself.
print( "1" )	
print( "2" )

# Primes for numbers above 3
for number in range( 3, 100, 2 ):
	# Attempt to divide this number by every number between 2 and one less than itself
	for div in range(2,number-1):
		# use the mod function to see if their is a remainder in the division
		if ( number % div ) == 0:
			break
	else:
		print(number)
</pre>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>
public class prime {
	public static void main( String args[] ) {
		System.out.println( "Prime Numbers between 1 and 100");

		// Prime Numbers are numbers only divisible by 1 and itself.
		System.out.println( "1" );
		System.out.println( "2" );

		// Primes for numbers above 3
		for ( int number = 3; number <=100; number += 2 ) {
			// Attempt to divide this number by every number between 2 and one less than itself
			int div = 2;
			for ( /**/; div < number; div++ ) {
				// use the mod function to see if their is a remainder in the division
				if ( ( number % div ) == 0 )
					break;
			}
			if ( div == number )
				System.out.println(number);
		}
	}
}

<h3>Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
<p>
Of the most common and basic coding examples is to code a solution for the Fibonacci sequence. A Fibonacci sequence is a function where F(N) equals
F(n-1) + F(n-2); that is the summation of the previous two values in the sequence. Originally, the seed sequence was F(0) = 1 and F(1) = 1, but modern
solutions use F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. This sequence can be written in a very short recursive algorithm.
</p>

<h4>Python</h4>
<pre>
# Fibonacci Sequence
# Is a sum (addition) of the previous two numbers in the sequence, as
#	F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
# Where
# 	F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1
# Hence 
#	F(2) = 0 + 1 [F(1) + F(0)] = 1
#	F(3) = 1 + 1 [F(2) + F(1)] = 2

# Recursive Solution
def Fibonacci(n):
	# F(0) and F(1) case
	if n==0:
		return 0
	if n==1:
		return 1
	return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)

# Fibonacci Sequence to F(10)
for number in range( 0, 10 ):
	print( Fibonacci(number) )
</pre>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>
public class fibonacci {
	public static void main( String args[] ) {
		System.out.println( "Fibonacci Sequence to F(10)");

		for ( int number = 0; number < 10; number++ )
			System.out.println( Fibonacci( number ) );

	}
	
	// Recursive Solution
	public static int Fibonacci( int n) {
		if ( n == 0 ) return 0;
		if ( n == 1 ) return 1;
		return Fibonacci( n - 1 ) + Fibonacci( n - 2 );
	}
}
